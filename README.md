## Introduction
Welcome to my repository dedicated to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning and daily practice questions for competitive programming. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in enhancing their DSA skills and preparing for competitive programming challenges.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized into various sections to facilitate easy navigation and efficient learning:

### 1. Daily Practice Questions
- A collection of questions that I practice daily, categorized by difficulty level (beginner, intermediate, advanced).
- Solutions are provided with explanations for better understanding.
- Contributions and discussions on alternate solutions are encouraged.

### 2. Data Structures and Algorithms
- Detailed explanations and implementations of various data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, stacks, queues, etc.
- Each data structure is accompanied by example problems to demonstrate its application.
- Comprehensive coverage of key algorithms, including sorting, searching, dynamic programming, divide and conquer, etc.
- Each algorithm section includes a theoretical explanation, implementation details, and example problems.

### 3. Resources and References
- Curated list of resources for learning DSA and competitive programming, including books, websites, online courses, and more.

This is a live repo and will be updated as more content is added and new learning strategies are adopted. Happy coding! ðŸš€
